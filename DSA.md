 *** Data Sturctures are classified int two types 
  1. primitive(Variable)                          2. non-primitives(objects)

                                            |a. linear DS| ⬇️  |b. Non-Linear DS|
                     -> linear D.S are is a sequenece order⬇️ arranged in simple and straight line but in more complex ways
                                  -> Arrays                ⬇️       -> Trees
                                  -> Linked Lists          ⬇️        -> Graph
                                  -> Stack                 ⬇️
                                  -> Queue                 ⬇️
