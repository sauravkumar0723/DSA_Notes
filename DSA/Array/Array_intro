# Array
- An Array is a collection values stored in contignuous memory location.
- All the element in an array have same data type and you acess each Values using it index.
- index will start from zero.
Syntax :- int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
          int arr[] = new int[5];
** There are two types of Array.
   1. Rectangular Array
   2. JAgged Array
Rectangular Array:- in Rectangular Array we have 
1. One-Dimensional Array (1D Array)
- Stores elements in a single row
- Accessed using one index
- Most commonly used
Example:
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};
Representation:
Index →  0   1   2   3
Value → 10  20  30  40

2. Two-Dimensional Array (2D Array)
- Stored in rows and columns
- Also called matrix
- Accessed using two indices
Example:
int arr[2][3] = {
  {1, 2, 3},
  {4, 5, 6}
};
Representation:
1  2  3
4  5  6

3. Multi-Dimensional Array
- Array with more than two dimensions
- Less commonly used
Example (3D Array):
int arr[2][2][2];

** Jagged Array
- Array of arrays
- Each row can have different length
Example (Java):
int arr[][] = {
  {1, 2},
  {3, 4, 5},
  {6}
};
