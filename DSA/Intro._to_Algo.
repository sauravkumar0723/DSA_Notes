### Introduction to Algorithm
- An Algorithm is a finite set of well-defined instructions designed to solve a Problem or Perform a Computation.
- it takes input systematic and produces the desired output
- A good algorithm must be clear, efficient and scalable to handle large amounts of data efficency.

* Different way to Write an algorithm.
i. writing a plain English. (Instruction Step by step)
ii. PseudoCode -> is a mix of plain language and structure formatting
iii. writing using flowCharts

** Time Complexity
  -- The time complexity is the rate at which the execution time of an algortim increases with gradual increase of input size.
  -- it is not just the total time taken by the program to excute but how the time grows as input grows

** Space Complexity
 -- refers to the amount of extra space or memory that an algorithm uses as the input size increases

*** The unit of time complexity & space complexity
--> Asympotic notation:-> are the way of denotaing the time and space complexity of Algorithms
    1. Big-O Notation — O(n) - > linear search
    2. Omega Notation — Ω(n)
    -- Represents the best-case time complexity
    -- Lower bound of an algorithm
Example:
Binary Search (best case) → Ω(1)

   3.  Theta Notation — Θ(f(n))

    -- Represents the average case
    -- Tight bound (best = worst)
Example:
Merge Sort → Θ(n log n)
Note: 1. PrintStatment :-> for no matter Println statment whatever input provided too same time only. e.g:- variables statment, print statment are all these constatn time only
